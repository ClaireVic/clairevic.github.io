<title>Why do Computers Now?</title>

    I wish I had learned coding much earlier as
            an undergraduate but I was thrown into a C++ class and never wanted to
            see it again.  I met some Computer Science students in graduate school, the second time I went, and they taught me how powerful Computer Science is
            but I figured my chance to learn was over.  I signed up for a free 
            computing conference and my perspective changed again, no offense Pure Math.
            The keynote speaker majored in math and learned computers so why not 
            go back to school, at one of places I teach, and learn?  I am old, I just
            had a really big birthday, but I discovered I can learn new things.  I am 
            really liking web design and at some point I want to go back to C++
            and learn to program the robot to dance like they did at the conference
            and get kids interested in Science Technology Engineering and MATHEMATICS,
            even the pure kind. The National Association of University Women, Los
            Angeles Branch, is starting a youth program.

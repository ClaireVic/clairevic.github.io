    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>During slavery slaves were not allowed to read or write.  The punishment for learning to read or write, which has been well documented, was to place the slaves' legs on two different horses and have the horses run in two separate directions, thus tearing the person literally apart in most regions.  However, despite this punishment some slaves did learn to read.  Those slaves were usually the slaves that were "house slaves" and were mixed with white.  Both Mary Church Terrell's parents were house slaves and thus when slavery ended they had the advantage over most slaves of not being able to be identified as a person of African descent and being educated.</p>
    <p> Thus, Mary Eliza Church was born September 23, 1863 in Memphis with priviledge and wealth.  Her father became the first Black millionaire in the South.  Mary Eliza Church attended Oberlin College and was one of first African-Americans to receive a college degree.  </p>

  <section><h2>She Made Lemonade</h2>
  <p>After Mary Eliza Church graduated from college she heard about an old classmate being lynched.  This sent her life into a direction of social justice.  Her major three accomplishments, in my opinion, was her co-founding the following three organizations:  The College Alumni Club, now the National Association of University Women, the National Association of Colored Women, and NAACP.</p>
<p>The NAACP only had three female founding members and two where Black.  The other Black woman was Ida B. Wells.  The NAACP helped bring racial integration to the USA and the most notable achievement, which sometimes I question, was the Brown vs. the Board of Education in Topeka, KS.  The National Association of Colored Women provided childcare and kindergartens as well as orphan care at a time when Blacks paid taxes but didn't get any of the services.  The final achievement in this section that I will talk about is her co-founding the National Assoication of University Women, NAUW, which I am a member of which is why this page is green and white because those are our colors.  NAUW is an educational association that has helped numerous children go to college through scholarships, including me.  She gave Mary Mcleod Behune the idea of starting the National Council of Negro Women which is an integral part of the Black community even today.

    <h2>She Never Stopped</h2>
    <p>Even though Mary Church Terrell was a senior citizen she organized a boycott and buycott of restaurants who refused to serve everyone in Washington DC.  She died on July 24th, 1954 a short time after the Supreme Court struck down separate but equal.  She still lives on through the organizations she started.</p>
